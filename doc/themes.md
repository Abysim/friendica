# Themes

* [Home](help)

The default Theme in Friendica is called [frio](https://github.com/friendica/friendica/tree/stable/view/theme/frio).

Open `Settings > Display > Custom Theme Settings` adjust the Theme to your liking. Select your preferred Appearance - light, dark or black - and your favorite Accent color. Click `Submit` to save your changes.

The `Custom` Appearance allows to tweak the themes CSS and set colors for UI elements. So called `schemestrings` can be shared between users.

In the `General Theme Settings` you can also find the [vier](https://github.com/friendica/friendica/tree/stable/view/theme/vier) Theme, which precedes frio and is no longer officially maintained.
